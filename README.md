# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is console version of rock paper scissors

It asks user pick from prompt and then game starts


This was medium-easy project and it took near 3 hours to complete.
This wasn't my first try in this project.
It was still my first time that i programmed whole game from 0 to end.

In this project i learned how to use functions. It is easier to use multiple functions than just few big ones.
I also tried to focus on commenting things.
